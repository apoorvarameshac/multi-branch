Multi-Branch Pipeline Overview

A Multi-Branch Pipeline is a CI/CD pattern where each branch in your version control system is treated as a separate “mini-pipeline” automatically. Branches are discovered dynamically and executed based on their respective pipeline definition (e.g., a Jenkinsfile or equivalent).
This approach helps you:

⦁	Automatically build/test every branch (feature, bugfix, release) without having to manually create jobs per branch.
⦁	Keep your pipeline definition as code inside each branch, so changes to the pipeline logic travel with the branch.
⦁	Apply branch-specific behavior (e.g., dev vs main vs release) using conditional logic.


Why Use It

⦁	Reduced maintenance: One job/project can handle all branches — you don’t create a new pipeline manually for every branch.
⦁	Parallel development: Feature branches, bugfixes, experiments — each can be validated automatically, reducing the risk of surprises when merging.
⦁	Pipeline evolves with code: Since the pipeline definition lives in-branch, changes to the build/test/deploy process are versioned alongside code.
⦁	Branch-aware workflows: Different stages or deployments can be triggered based on branch names, patterns, or conditions.


How It Works (High Level)

⦁	Developer pushes a new branch (e.g., feature/foo) or opens a Pull Request.
⦁	The multi-branch system scans the repository, detects the branch + finds the pipeline definition (Jenkinsfile or similar).
⦁	A pipeline is automatically triggered for that branch, executing the build/test/deploy logic defined inside it.
⦁	Optionally, branch conditions decide which stages run. E.g., only main branch triggers production deployment; dev branch runs integration tests, etc.
⦁	When the branch is merged or removed, the pipeline for that branch can be cleaned up automatically.
